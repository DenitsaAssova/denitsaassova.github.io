Hi, I am Denitsa, a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Informatics: Games Engineering from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My fascination with Game Development traces back to my early school years, ignited by the enchanting world of video games that captured my imagination when I was just six years old. Recognising my growing affinity for Maths around second grade, my parents enrolled me in advanced Maths classes, setting the stage for my academic journey.

Since third grade, my love for Maths led me to compete in numerous tournaments in my home country, Bulgaria. To further enhance my skills, I applied to the National Gymnasium of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. While there, I actively participated in the schoolâ€™s maths team and discovered the opportunity to blend my affinity for Maths with my love for video games. I began to wonder how video games were created.

The turning point came when I was introduced to Informatics, where the worlds of Maths and video games merged. Intrigued by the process of Game Development, I decided to delve deeper into this newfound interest. This decision led me to apply to TUM, where I embarked on my five-year Game Development journey. These years were filled with both wonder and challenge as I explored various Computer Science disciplines, ultimately specialising in Games Engineering.

My university experience not only improved my technical skills but also strengthened my love for video games. Now, equipped with knowledge in Maths, Informatics, and Games Engineering, my motivation persists as the same curiosity that initially sparked my interest in the gaming world fuels my ongoing journey.
